# Personal Finance Dashboard (Excel)

## Executive Summary
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics process using an M-Pesa statement to develop a **Personal Finance Dashboard** in Excel. The goal was to transform unstructured financial transactions into clean, analysis-ready data and uncover insights into spending patterns, income trends, and overall cash flow. The project showcases advanced Excel skills, including Power Query for cleaning and visualization design for storytelling.

## Business Problem
Individuals often lack a clear understanding of their spending behavior and cash flow due to scattered or unstructured transaction data. The challenge was to convert a raw M-Pesa statement—filled with inconsistencies—into a structured dataset that enables effective financial tracking and decision-making.

## Methodology
1. **Data Import:** Loaded the raw M-Pesa statement (CSV format) into Excel.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Used Power Query to remove duplicates, remove the unwanted transaction sentences to remain with the receipt's name using DAX standardize formats, and categorize transactions.  
3. **Data Transformation:** Created calculated columns for income, expenses, and transaction types.  
4. **Visualization:** Designed a dashboard to display financial card visuals, spending by category, and monthly trends.


## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Transformation using DAX (Power Query)  
- Data Visualization & Dashboard Design (Excel)  
- Financial Data Analysis & Categorization
